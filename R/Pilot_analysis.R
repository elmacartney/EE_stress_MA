# TODO - Erin about the directions of effects and expectations

#checking for outliers/potential typos---
#note that it very hard to check for typos/incorrect entries when there is a range of traits etc that are not directly comparable. Will need to re-do when effect sizes are calculated but all data looks correct at this stage
# TODO ask Erin for the rationale for this - also the naming?? why EC and CS????

# this may not be that useful as means and SD are measured on the same scale - maybe looking at CV (or z value) is more useful (i.e. )
